the c standard working draft documents are only
available in a hard to handle pdf format
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/documents

this project provides plain text and html versions
of the c99 and the c1x standards

the conversion is done using pdftotext -layout
with some cleanups, see translit.sh and tohtml.sh
scripts

the html version is best viewed in a 120 char wide
terminal with terminal based browser
(original text layout is used, structuring the text
properly would take considerable amount of effort)

features:
 internal links
 one page, easy to grep ascii only text

unfortunately some information is lost/garbled
(most notably mathematical notations around
floating point specs, and diff marks wrt previous
standards)
