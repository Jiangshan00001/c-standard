the c standard working draft documents are only
available in a hard to handle pdf format
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/documents

this project provides plain text and html versions
of the c99 and the c1x standards

the conversion is done using pdftotext and some
automated as well as manual cleanups

n????.txt:
	ascii version
n????.pre.html:
	html version with links but without formatting (original layout)
	best viewed in a 120 char wide terminal and text based browser
n????.html:
	html version with formatted text (partly manually done)

unfortunately some information is lost/garbled
(eg. emphasized and bold text, mathematical notations around
floating point specs, and diff marks wrt previous standards)
